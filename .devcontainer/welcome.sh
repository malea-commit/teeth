# Wired to postAttachCommand (NOT postStartCommand). This matters: in
# Codespaces, postStartCommand output is routed to the hidden creation log, so
# a banner there is invisible to students. postAttachCommand runs in a visible
# terminal, and because the lifecycle order is postCreate → postStart →
# postAttach, it fires only after the slow `pak` install has finished — so the
# banner doubles as a genuine "setup is done" signal.
#
# Note: `-u` and `pipefail` but deliberately NOT `-e`. This is a best-effort
# banner/onboarding script; a failure in the Workspace Trust config step below
# (e.g. node missing, unwritable settings) must NOT abort the script and rob the
# student of the "your Codespace is ready" banner. Steps guard themselves.

# Disable VS Code Workspace Trust for this Codespace. Without this, a repo a
# student opens via File → Open Folder starts in Restricted Mode (VS Code hasn't
# "trusted" that folder): they get a "do you trust the authors?" prompt, and
# Restricted Mode can suppress settings/features — e.g. the "run git fetch
# automatically?" prompt reappears. Disabling trust lets the Codespace's
# Machine-scope settings (arf console, autosave, git.autofetch off, …) apply
# cleanly to whatever folder the student opens — which is exactly why
# connect-repo no longer needs to seed a per-repo .vscode/settings.json (see its
# NOTE). A Codespace is an isolated, managed container GitHub already
# auto-trusts, so turning the check
# off is safe. It's an application-scoped setting, so it must live in VS Code's
# *user* settings — it can't go in devcontainer/workspace settings (those are
# ignored for it). Idempotent: only written once.

# NOTE: the R Tutorials extension (PPBDS.vscode-r-tutorials) is NOT installed
# here. An attach-time `code --install-extension` (tried, 2026-07) leaves the
# Activity Bar icon missing until the student reloads the window — and the
# first attempt silently installed nothing (the code CLI treats a path
# without a .vsix suffix as a marketplace identifier). The extension is baked
# into the image instead (RT_EXT_VERSION in the PPBDS/devcontainers
# Dockerfile), pre-extracted from the Open VSX .vsix so the icon exists from
# first paint.

# Give students a short terminal prompt: just the current folder name + "$",

# rebuilds PS1 on every render via PROMPT_COMMAND, so we override BOTH (clear
# PROMPT_COMMAND, set PS1) at the END of ~/.bashrc, where last-word-wins. We
# keep the folder name on purpose: it reinforces "which repo am I in?" — the
# same orientation connect-repo's auto-cd is about. Applies to new terminals
# (bashrc runs at shell start). Idempotent via the sentinel.
